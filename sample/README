BiPSim Sample Directory
===========================

Sample directory showing how `BiPSim` is typically used.

Directory structure
-------------------
  |
  +------ input (input files used for )
  |
  +------ output (output files generated by simulator, initially empty)
  |
  |
  + run.sh (simple shell script runnig sample simulation)
  + params.in (parameter file used to run sample simulation)
  + params_tetracyclin.in (parameter file used to run simulation with drugs)
  + format.in (file describing format of reactions used in simulator)

Examples
--------

Once you have installed BiPSim, move into this directory and run

```
../src/bipsim input/params.in
```

or (equivalently):

```
sh run.sh
```

This will run a simulator where replication, transcription and translation are
performed stochastically. Data used comes from *B. subtilis* annotation.

You can also run:

```
../src/bipsim input/params_tetracyclin.in
```

This will run the same simulation with an additional input file that describes
the injection of tetracyclin from t=1000 to t=1500. Tetracyclin is a drug that
inhibts translation by competing with tRNAs during the loading phase.

For each run, 3 output files are generated in `sample/output`
 - concentrations.txt: concentration of some chemicals over time.
 - reactions.txt: most popular reactions in the sytem over time.
 - chromosome.txt: evolution of double strand synthesis over time.
 
Developping your own simulation
-------------------------------

This sample directory shows the basic structure of a simulation. You can
develop your own simulation by:
 - cloning the current directory.
 - changing input files in the `input` directory. Number and order of input
files does not matter, as long as they are listed in `params.in`. Use
`format.in` and take a look at examples provided to write your own reactions.
 - adapt `params.in` to your need. Every parameter is documented to help you
define its value. When in doubt, you may simply keep the parameters
provided in the example file.
 - adapt `run.sh`.
