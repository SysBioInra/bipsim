BiPSim: stochastic simulation of cell processes
===================================================

A Gillespie-based simulator used to simulate biological processes
stochastically on a molecular level.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need a UNIX system running autoconf to install this software. Recent [boost](http://boost.org/) libraries are highly recommended.

### Installing

When in the main repository run the following commands:

```
./configure
make
```

If boost is not installed on your system, consider running (not recommended):

```
./configure --disable-boost
make
```

You can make installation system-wide by running

```
sudo make install
```
You may also try reading the [INSTALL](INSTALL) file for more advanced uses (this is a file that comes with autoconf, we did not write it).

### Running

Once you have setup your parameter file and reactions files, run

```
src/bipsim path/to/params.in
```

If you do not run the program from the build directory, do not forget to
add the full path to `src/bipsim`.
If you made installation system-wide, you may simply run

```
bipsim path/to/params.in
```

For example, you can use the data provided in sample for your first run:

```
cd sample
../src/bipsim input/params.in
```

3 output files are generated in `sample/output`
 - concentrations.txt: concentration of some chemicals over time.
 - reactions.txt: most popular reactions in the sytem over time.
 - chromosome.txt: evolution of double strand synthesis over time.

Running tests
-------------

A couple of unit and integration tests are provided. In order to run them,
you need to reconfigure the package:

```
./configure --enable-unit-tests --enable-integration-tests
make check
```
