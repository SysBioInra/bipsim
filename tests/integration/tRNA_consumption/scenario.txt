SCENARIO
--------

Right amount of metabolites is consumed in a translation-like process.

INPUT
-----

 - genetic code (codon to tRNA mapping).
 - translation process with simplified loading + translocation steps.
 - one ribosome that is inactivated at the end of translation.
 - tRNAs
 - mRNA with a predefined codon composition.

OUTPUT
------

Metabolite concentrations at the end of simulation (when all reactions have been performed).

VALIDATION METRICS
------------------

Number of metabolites consumed must strictly match codon composition of mRNA.
