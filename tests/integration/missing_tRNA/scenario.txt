SCENARIO
--------
A missing tRNA necessary to create a protein block the translation process.

INPUT
-----
 - genetic code
 - translation-like process
 - one mRNA using a codon loading a tRNA whose concentration is 0.
 - several ribosomes.

OUTPUT
------
Number of proteins produced.

VALIDATION METRICS
------------------
Number of proteins should be 0. If simulation is run until all ribosomes are jammed, total reaction rate should reach 0.
