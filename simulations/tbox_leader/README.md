This simulation case was generated by copying the "hybrid constant" gene expression model (detailed modeling of 5% of genes, constant metabolite numbers) and adding the following files:
 - tbox_regulation.in: Declare position of t-box terminator/anti-terminator and aborted gene products.
 - tyrosine_depletion.in: Simulate a stress where charged tyrosine tRNAs are suddenly depleted. This file also defines a more realistic tRNA charging reaction for tyrosine.
 
Additionally, we modifed the following files:
 - transcription.in: We removed the aggregate transcription reactions for the two transcription units containing the tyrS gene (U2301 and U2303)
 - translation.in: We removed the tyrosine tRNA charging reaction (see tyrosine_depletion.in).
 - params.in: We changed the output molecules and set the end time to 1000.
 
Results were obtained by running the following command:
```bipsim params.in```
